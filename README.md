# Convert your own Models!

[The Upscayl wiki has a guide on how to convert pre-existing ESRGAN models!](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/wiki/%F0%9F%96%A5%EF%B8%8F-Model-Conversion---Create-more-AI-models!)

# Models

This repository has animevideo models for scales x2, x3 and x4. You can use Upscayl's scale option according to the model selected.

* RealESRGANv3: Lightweight and faster version of the default model, with slightly worse Upscayling performance.
* AnimeVideo (Digital Art) models for scales x2, x3 and x4: After selecting these models you can use Upscayl's scale option without a hitch.
* "Ultrasharp": We still don't know what this model is, but we accidently included it in place of Ultrasharp in v2.0.1 and @royal-rigolo liked it, so here it is!
* Uniscale_Restore by Kim2091.
