# Upscayl - Custom Models

This repository will contain extra models that users can download and use in Upscayl. Upscayl v2.5 comes with a Custom Models option where users can select a `models` folder and use their own imported models.

## Instructions

### Using Models
1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/upscayl/custom-models/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Open Upscayl and click the Settings tab.
4. Click on `Select Folder` button under _CUSTOM MODELS_ section.
5. Select the `models` folder in the earlier extracted folder.
6. Go back to Upscayl screen and select your custom models.

### Converting Models

WIP: Try finding ways to convert your models to NCNN, the format Upscayl uses, for now.

# Models

* RealESRGANv3: Lightweight and faster version of the default model, with slightly worse Upscayling performance.
* AnimeVideo (Digital Art) models for scales x2, x3 and x4: After selecting these models you can use Upscayl's scale option without a hitch.
* "Ultrasharp": We still don't know what this model is, but we accidently included it in place of Ultrasharp in v2.0.1 and @royal-rigolo liked it, so here it is!
